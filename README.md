# Compressed Interaction Graph based Framework for Muti-behavior Recommendation

This repository contains TensorFlow codes and datasets for the paper.

## Environment
The codes of CIGF are implemented and tested under the following development environment:
* python=3.6.12
* tensorflow=1.14.0
* numpy=1.16.0
* scipy=1.5.2

## Datasets
We utilized three datasets to evaluate CIGF: <i>Beibei, Tmall, </i>and <i>IJCAI Contest</i>. The <i>purchase</i> behavior is taken as the target behavior for all datasets. The last target behavior for the test users are left out to compose the testing set. We filtered out users and items with too few interactions.

## Just Run ItÔºÅ

* Beibei
```
python base_framework_origin_final.py --data beibei 
```
* Tmall
```
python base_framework_origin_final.py --data tmall --gnn_layer 4
```
* IJCAI
```
python base_framework_samp_final.py --data ijcai
```
